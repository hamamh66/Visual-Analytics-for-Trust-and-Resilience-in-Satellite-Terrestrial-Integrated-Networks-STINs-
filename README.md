This repository provides a reproducible visual analytics framework for analyzing trust, integrity, resilience, and performance dynamics in Satellite–Terrestrial Integrated Networks (STINs). The implementation is designed to support human-in-the-loop interpretation of secure STIN operations by transforming cryptographic and trust signals into interpretable visual representations.

The framework builds on publicly available NASA Earth observation metadata and simulates satellite–terrestrial exchanges with integrity verification, trust evolution, and performance monitoring. A dedicated Google Colab notebook generates integrative visual analytics figures that jointly capture integrity events, trust dynamics, latency behavior, and storage scalability, enabling explainable analysis of system behavior under benign and adversarial conditions.

This repository accompanies the research article “Visual Analytics for Trust and Resilience in Satellite–Terrestrial Integrated Networks (STINs)” and is intended for researchers and practitioners working on secure space–ground networking, trust-aware systems, resilience engineering, and explainable AI for cyber–physical infrastructures.

Key features include:

Reproducible STIN simulation using public NASA CMR metadata

Visual analytics for integrity, trust evolution, latency, and storage overhead

Human-interpretable dashboards and integrative figures (no metric-only plots)

Google Colab–ready execution with minimal setup

Designed to complement, not duplicate, system-level security evaluations
